# MachineLearningControl
Machine Learning-Based Control of Dynamical Systems 
Requirements and Design
Implementation (training) of controllers to steer and stabilize a dynamical system
The dynamica system is a software platform of multi-tenant e-commerce shops

## Implementation of the following packages:
- 1 Non-Linear and Non-Stationary Environment (Identifiability, Stability)
- 2 Environment with Latent States (Observability)
- 3 Transfer Learning within Environemnt Instances (Generalizability under Sparsity)
- 4 Reinforcement Learning Control (Automated Control Synthesis)
