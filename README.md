Machine Learning-Based Control of Dynamical Systems 

## Lecture notes and Project Requirements

## Implementation of the following packages:

- 1 Non-Linear and Non-Stationary Environment (Identifiability, Stability)
- 2 Environment with Latent States (Observability)
- 3 Transfer Learning within Environemnt Instances (Generalizability under Sparsity)
- 4 Reinforcement Learning Control (Automated Control Synthesis)
